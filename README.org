*** Choosing a time frame
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On my projects I choose the following timeframes

- Between releases :: Compare hotspots between releases to evaluate
     your long-term improvements.
- Over iterations :: If you work iteratively, measure between each
     iteration.  This lets you spot code that starts to grow into
     hotspots early.
- Around significant events :: Define the temporal period around
     significant events, such as reorganizations of code or
     personnel.  When you make large redesigns or change the way you
     work, it will reflect in the code.
#+END_QUOTE

- Start with a long period :: 1 to 2 years will allow you to spot
     long-term trends.

*** Enclosure diagrams
Uses /circle packing/ to represent the system.  Each circle is a
module, from hibernate core all the way down to individual namespaces.
*Circle radius* denotes the lines of code contained in the modules
dependent on the module the circle represents.  *Color intensity* of
the module denotes the number of revisions.

It looks like directories are blue and =.java= files are red.
*** Hotspots and individual coding styles
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A project's success depends on the coding skills of the people
involved.  As humans we vary a lot in our capabilities.  A cognitively
demanding task like programming amplifies those variations.  That's
one reason why there's a large difference in quality between the code
of different programmers, even on the same team.  Given these
differences, it is hardly surprising that the expertise and coding
techniques of individual developers make up one reason for clusters of
hotspots.
#+END_QUOTE
**** Specialization
If one developer is designing all the modules in one area then there
will be hotspots in that area over a given time.  "This may be one
reason why hotspots attract each other."
**** Strategic decisions
Running up deliberate technical debt to meet a deadline.
**** Lack of knowledge
There may be a lack of knowledge in the team that is working on this
part of the codebase.

There may be an opportunity to get training for the team or shuffle
roles to add coverage to a blind spot
*** Does measuring code change improve fault prediction?

*** Different features stabilize at different rates
"Change patterns suggest new modular boundaries"

Consider a namespace with three functions.  Two of those functions
depend on several other namespaces.  One function is self-contained.
The namespace undergoes changes whenever the two dependent functions
change and the self-contained function comes along for the ride.  A
naive developer could accidentally change the self-contained function
because they are looking at the namespace, when in fact they should
only be concerned with changing the dependent functions.

Or the example from the book:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[Code Maat's] =app.clj= module has changed several times, each time
for different reasons.  It has three responsibilities, and therefore
three reasons to change.  Refactoring this module into three
independent ones would isolate the responsibilities and stabilize the
code.
#+END_QUOTE

It may or may not stabilize the code, but at least it would allow the
three refactored namespaces to evolve at rates consistent with the
dependent namespaces for which they are responsible.
*** Visualizing hibernate data

  python ~/projects/maat-scripts/transform/csv_as_enclosure_json.py --structure hib_lines.csv --weights hib_freqs.csv --weightcolumn 1 > hib_hotspot.json

#+END_SRC
*** Evolve your modules to stability as soon as possible
See http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2012/12/the-active-set-of-classes.html
- Graph time when a class is related to its last modification
- Calculate /class closure/ as the time at which a class is no
  longer modified
** Chapter 6
Rough complexity metric based on whitespace
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python ~/projects/maat-scripts/miner/complexity_analysis.py ~/projects/hibernate-orm/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/cfg/Configuration.java

  n,total,mean,sd,max
  3389,8180,2.41,1.63,14
#+END_SRC
- n :: number of lines in the file
- total :: total accumulated indentations detected
- mean :: average indentations per line
- sd :: standard deviation of indentations per line
- max :: maximum indentations per line

Whew, 14!

Compare to running the code on the main dev branch:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  n,total,mean,sd,max
  769,933,1.21,0.76,6
#+END_SRC

All numbers reduced.
*** Large amounts of indenting suggest the presence of application logic
*** Law of increasing complexity
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As an evolving program is continually changed, its complexity, reflecting deterioritating structure, increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.
